# ? manages diverse package manager updates on linux, mainly debian and ubuntu;
# ?  sensitive to most errors in command chain and often requires human conformations;
# ? - [if installed] `apt`, updates and cleans up:
# ?   `update`, update info of packages from repository;
# ?   `upgrade`, update packages;
# ?   `full-upgrade`, update packages including possibly breaking changes into the system;
# ?   `autoremove`, remove unused packages;
# ?   `purge`, remove residual package configs;
# ?   `autoclean`, remove non-relevant downloaded packages;
# ? - [if installed] `snap`, updates;
# ? - [if installed] `flatpak`, update & auto-remove:
# ?   `update`, update packages;
# ?   `autoremove`, remove unused packages;
# ? - [if present] `non-managed`, launch `update.user` script intended for updating your system parts not managed by any package manager;
# ?   modify `update.user` script in the same folder for your system configuration and liking or delete script to permanently disable;
# ? - [if present] `firmware`, updates firmware drivers and firmware itself;
# ? - [if present] `initramfs`, updates initramfs for all kernels;
# ? - [if installed] `dist`, perform distribution version update; see `update.dist` in same folder to see supported commands/distributions;
# ? args:
# ?   --no-apt, no-apt, --noapt, noapt - disable apt commands;
# ?   --no-snap, no-snap, --nosnap, nosnap - disable snap commands;
# ?   --no-flat, no-flat, --noflat, noflat, --no-flatpak, no-flatpak, --noflatpak, noflatpak - disable flatpak commands;
# ?   --user, user, --full, full - enable user script update at `update.user` in same folder as script;
# ?   --firmware, firmware, --full, full - enable firmware update;
# ?   --initramfs, initramfs, --full, full - enable initramfs update for all kernels;
# ?   --dist, dist, --full, full - enable dist upgrading command, executes `update.dist` in same folder;
